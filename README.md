# Advent of Code 2023
Here... we... go! Let's use this year's event to learn some [Go](https://go.dev/)! We'll have full solutions for each day, so grab your milk and cookies and strap in for an exciting holiday season of coding!

## Setup
Not much to do here. We're using [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) to load your :cookie:. Advent of Code uses cookie-based authentication for accessing puzzle inputs, and so you'll just need to add the following to `app/app.env`:
```
COOKIE=<YOUR_COOKIE>
```
Your :cookie: is only added to the request header for those fun puzzle inputs. I promise. Take a look for yourself if you don't believe me.
